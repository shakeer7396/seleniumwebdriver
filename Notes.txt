Some of the important points are 
****How to add file to github with commands
* We have two repositories one is remote repository and another is local repository
* Local repository means it is git repository its final stage is commit, commit with a message
* Remote repository means it is a github repository when pushing our code into this repository
1. Which file you want to add first open in file explorer directly file location or right click then go properties go to location.
2. Right click on folder it shows git bash here then click first time you add this file then you create local repository for this file 

--   Round-1 ------

	* git init (Create new local Repository)
	-> It creats empty local repository with location url wit .git extension
	
	1. Provide user info to git repo. (one time) starting
	
	-> git config --global user.name "shaikshakeerss123"
	-> git config --global user.email "shaikshakeerss123@gmail.com"
	-> git status -> It will show untracked files status
	
--   Round-2 ------	

	2. Adding files/folders to staging/indexing
	
	-> git add -A 	-->Adding all files & folders going into staging -> It means checking place anything wrong U can change there no problem
	-> git add filename		->Adding single file with name
	-> git add *.java		->Adding all java into staging
	-> git add foldername	->Adding single folder with name

	
	3. Commit the code into Local(git) repository 
	
	-> git commit -m "commit message"		->Its storing all files in local repo
	-> git status 		->It shows working tree clean 

	
	4. Connect local repo with remote repo (one time only)
	
	-> First open github and login then create a new repository with same file name what is in the eclipse put it public
	-> It creates empty github repo and generates Url for this repository you copy this and paste into comand it connects local repo
	
	-> git remote add origin "https://github.com/shaikshakeerss123/Demo1.git"
	-> git push origin master		-> Pushing local repo to remote repo
		
	-> It asks SignIn for first time only you take token option for that go to github click profile in left side 
	go to setting in below developer setting there click it and go to token classes if there you can use or else
	 generate new token then select all fields below then click generate copy this token and paste into signup token field and click
	 -> Then all files going to remote repo its done
	 
**************** Github shows some issue while pushing when change git hub account **********************************
1. So you go to Credential manager in below search option in laptop window then go to window credentials there
 delete previous github details all Then come again git bash and push
 
 
--   Round-2 ------

* adding, deleting files, and code in eclipse work place use below commands only

1. git add -A
2. git commit -m "Message"
3. git push origin master


--   Round-3 ------

1. if you want to add direct from github first full pull then add and push from your side
	-> git pull "https://github.com/shaikshakeerss123/Demo1.git" 		-> Pulling code from github to eclipse
	
	
--   Round-4 ------	

* Clone new repository to local system (In company already project there have some changes then do this)

	-> First Create one new folder where you want to kept then open git bash that location then use below commands
	-> git clone "https://github.com/noorgangavaram/AutomationNopcommerce.git"
	-> Its all data copied into this folder then open this folder into your eclipse works space go on work 
	-> Go to file in eclipse click open projects from file system click directorary then select project folder then click finish
	-> After working you want to store your git then same first to end process
	-> In company seperate branches there then push personal to main
	
	
	--   Round-5 ------	

** Direct adding update code or files into existing github repository using eclipse 

	-> Right click on folder Teams option showing hover it then click commit 
	-> When commit option is not showing it shows apply path and share means your github remote repository link 
	is breaking with local git repository then you click share it shows Configure Git Repository heading its 
	automatically take the git location you just click finish button its connected,
	-> Again open teams its showing all commit and push both, but first commit then select one file and click + btn
	 click single file stagged, then all files click ++ btn in unstaging to stagging changed
	 -> Gave a meaning full message in message section then click commit option
	 -> Again open teams then click push Branch Master option all default there just click push
	 -> It opens small box enter user name  and passw and Tok
	  -> click below its pushing and showing link just click close and check your github
	  
	  
	  --   Round-6 ------	

** Direct adding update code or files into new github repository using eclipse 
** Next

 	--   Round-7 ------	
 	
 **	Changing Branch name globallay with git bash commands
 
 	->git init (Create new local Repository)
	-> It creats empty local repository with location url wit .git extension
	-> git status checking branch name
	-> git config --global init.defaultBranch main
	-> cd.. comming out from folder
	-> open another file int file explorer (or) eclipse after open git bash and do git init then check git status
	-> Automatically it changed to main but previous one is still working with master no issue
	-> Same you want to change main to master with same file, It still working main but again creating new file its changed master
	

		--   Round-8 ------	
	**Already fetched once the repo url again you want to fetch 
	-> First check git remote --verbose   (There shows urls)
	-> Just change small in previous one add 
	-> git remote set-url origin "https://github.com/shakeer7396/seleniumwebdriver.git"
