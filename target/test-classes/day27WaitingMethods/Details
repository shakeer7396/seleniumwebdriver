Wait Commands
----------
Synchronization
------- 
* When running the multiple Urls its execute more fast then one another one, so not opened another Url so Throughs error
* These exceptions are 
a) NoSuchElementException:
	->Locator is correct but when execution that element is not available in the web page, It is Synchronization problem
b) ElementNotFoundException
	->When ever your locator is not matching or in-correct
	

* Thread.sleep() is not a WebDriver command it is a java program command
	--> Advantages :- easy to use
	--> Disadvantages :- 
	1. If the time is not sufficient then you will get exception
	2. It will wait for maximum time out. this will reduce the performance of automation script.
	3. multiple times we need to write, we use so automation script also running slow

* WebDriver wait methods are 2 types :- 1) implicit wait		2) explicit wait/fluent wait

 1) implicit wait 
 	-> driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(10)); Its limit time 10sec
 	-----------Advantages----------------
 	-> single time/one statement
 	-> It will not wait till maximum time if the element is available
 	-> Applicable for all the elements
 	-> Easy to use
 	
 	-------------Disadvantages-----------------
 	-> If the time is not sufficient then you will get exception

 2) explicit wait/fluent wait
 	-> declaration
 	-> use
 	These two are main conditions for explicit wait
 	-----------Adv---------
 	-> Conditional based it will work more effectively
 	-> Finding element in inclusive(for some conditions)
 	-> It will wait condition to be true, then consider the time
 	-> We need to write multiple statements for multiple elements
