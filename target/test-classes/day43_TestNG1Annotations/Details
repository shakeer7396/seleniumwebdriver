Annotations
--------------

@Test ,is using for validation
@BeforeMethod
@AfterMethod

@BeforeClass
@AfterClass

@BeforeTest
@AfterTest

@BeforeSuite
@AfterSuite

TC1
----
1) Login	--> @BeforeMethod is using there because  --Pre requisite
2) Search	--> @Test Its main test functionality
3) Logout	--> @AfterMethod  because every time executing after the functionality, its came 2 times execute once --Exit criteria
4) Login	--> @
5) Adv search -> @Test Its also main test functionality
6) Logout	--> @


TC2
-----
1)Login		-->@BeforeClass		--There login can executes only once Before the test in the class
2)Search	-->@Test
3)advSearch -->@Test
4)Logout	-->@AfterClass		--There logout can executes only once After the test in the class
//All the Test will be part of the class, class contains the test methods.

//Above 2 types of annotations are use only in class level only single class is enough
//But  Below 2 types of annotations are use more test cases atleast 2 so we have Xml

Xml
-------
<suite name="suite">
<test name ="Test1">
<classes>
<class name ="day43" />
</classes>
</test>

<test name ="Test2">
<classes>
<class name ="day44" />
</classes>
</test>
</suite>

**Annotations will control order of execution.and Annotations decide when to execute those methods
**Annotations will participate only in execution not in results


Assertions Types 
----------------------
* Assertions are multiple types main they are 2 Kinds
1) Hard Assertions
2) Soft Assertions


Hard assertions 
----
we can access from "Assert" class
methods are static
* If hard assertions failed then rest of the statements will not be executed.


Soft Assertions
------
we can access through "SoftAssert" object
SoftAssert sa = new SoftAssert();
sa.assertTrue();
 if soft assertion got failed then rest of the statement still execute.
